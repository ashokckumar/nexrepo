 Record Terminal Session (Text Output) â€” No Built-in Shortcut
There is no native keyboard shortcut in Windows CMD or PowerShell to start logging/recording text. You must:

Manually start Start-Transcript in PowerShell (no shortcut).

Use tee or output redirection manually (>, >>).

If you want a shortcut to launch CMD and start logging automatically, you'd need to make a custom batch file or shortcut icon, not just a keypress.
